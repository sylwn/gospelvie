The quick and easy way to embed native Flickr slideshows of your Flickr photosets in your posts and pages.

== Description ==

Easily embed slideshows of your [Flickr photosets](http://www.steves-digicams.com/knowledge-center/how-tos/online-sharing-social-networking/how-to-create-a-set-within-flickr.html#b "What are photosets in Flickr")
in your posts and pages with this **Flickr set slideshows** plugin.

Once you have linked your Flickr account to the plugin (see Plugin Setup section),
creating a slideshow of one of your Flickr photosets is as easy as choosing the set and the slideshow's dimensions from a drop down list.
You can then embed the slideshow anywhere in your posts or pages by copying and pasting a [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API "Shortcodes in Wordpress").

When you create or edit a slideshow, Flickr set slideshow will provide you with an instant preview.
